## My process
I began by planning the project. I chose to create the mobile viewport first and opted for the Bootstrap Framework. After completing the styling phase, I will proceed to the scripting phase. I have already started creating JavaScript to validate user input formatting.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript (ES6)

### What I learned

I've learned JavaScript, specifically focusing on regular expressions. I consider this a new concept that I've acquired.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
let pattern = /^(0[1-9]|1[0-2])$/;
```

### Continued development

In the next project, I am interested in using the React library for development, and I have chosen Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Useful resources

- [Javascript.info](https://javascript.info/) - This helped me for learn regular expression.
